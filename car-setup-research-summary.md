## Suspension Geometry

### Camber
**Definition**: The vertical inclination of the tire when viewed from the front or rear of the vehicle.

**Typical Settings**:
- **Road Cars**: 0.5° to 1° negative camber
- **GT3/GT4 Cars**: -3° to -5° front, -2.5° to -4° rear
- **F1**: Highly variable based on track characteristics

**Effects on Handling**:
- **Negative Camber** (top of tire tilted inward):
  - **Cornering**: Increases contact patch during cornering, maximizing grip from outside tires
  - **Straight Line**: Reduces braking and acceleration grip
  - **Tire Wear**: Can cause uneven wear patterns and increased heat generation
  - **Optimal Use**: High-speed corners and tracks with many turns

**Tuning Guidelines**:
- Monitor tire temperatures across three sections (inside, middle, outside)
- Target temperature variation: <9°C front, <5°C rear (GT3/GT4)
- More camber for tracks with high-speed corners
- Less camber for tracks with long straights and low-speed corners

### Toe
**Definition**: The angle of the tires when viewed from above, relative to the vehicle's centerline.

**Types**:
- **Toe-In**: Tires point toward vehicle centerline
- **Toe-Out**: Tires point away from vehicle centerline

**Effects on Handling**:
- **Front Toe-Out**:
  - **Turn-In**: Sharpens initial turn-in response
  - **Stability**: May reduce straight-line stability
  - **Tire Wear**: Increases tire scrub
  
- **Rear Toe-In**:
  - **Stability**: Improves straight-line stability
  - **Cornering**: Can induce understeer
  - **Tire Wear**: Minimal impact when properly set

**Typical Settings**:
- **Front**: Slight toe-out for improved turn-in
- **Rear**: Minimal toe-in for stability

### Caster
**Definition**: The angle of the steering axis when viewed from the side of the vehicle.

**Effects on Handling**:
- **Positive Caster** (steering axis tilted back):
  - **Stability**: Improves straight-line tracking
  - **Cornering**: Increases tire lean angle during cornering
  - **Steering**: Increases steering effort but provides better feel
  - **Return**: Helps steering wheel return to center

**Typical Settings**:
- **Racing Applications**: 5-10 degrees positive caster
- **Drag Racing**: Up to 10 degrees (full-tube chassis)

## Aerodynamics & Downforce

### Wing Settings
**Function**: Generate downforce to increase tire grip at high speeds.

**Trade-offs**:
- **High Downforce**:
  - **Cornering**: Maximum grip through high-speed corners
  - **Top Speed**: Reduced due to increased drag
  - **Stability**: Improved in windy conditions
  
- **Low Downforce**:
  - **Top Speed**: Higher straight-line speed
  - **Cornering**: Reduced grip in high-speed corners
  - **Fuel Economy**: Better due to reduced drag

**Typical F1 Settings**:
- **Front Wing**: 20-30 (track dependent)
- **Rear Wing**: 10-20 (track dependent)
- **General Rule**: Slightly rear-biased setup (1-2 points more rear than front)

**Track-Specific Adjustments**:
- **High-Speed Tracks** (Monza, Spa): Low downforce for top speed
- **Twisty Tracks** (Monaco, Hungary): High downforce for cornering grip
- **Mixed Tracks**: Balanced approach favoring corner exit performance

## Dampers & Springs

### Spring Rates
**Function**: Control vehicle ride height and resist body roll during cornering.

**Selection Criteria**:
- **Soft Springs**:
  - **Grip**: Better mechanical grip over bumps
  - **Comfort**: Improved ride quality
  - **Aero**: May allow excessive ride height changes (aerodynamic cars)
  
- **Stiff Springs**:
  - **Precision**: More precise handling response
  - **Aero**: Maintains consistent ride height (important for downforce)
  - **Track Surface**: Better for smooth tracks

**Measurement**: Suspension frequency (Hz or CPM - cycles per minute)
- **Road Cars**: ~80 CPM
- **Racing (Non-Aero)**: Up to 170 CPM
- **Aero Cars**: Often much stiffer to maintain ride height consistency

### Damper Tuning

**Bump (Compression) Damping**:
- **Purpose**: Controls suspension compression when hitting bumps
- **Tuning Process**:
  1. Start with full soft settings
  2. Gradually increase until side-hop is eliminated
  3. Avoid overly stiff settings that cause harsh ride

**Rebound (Extension) Damping**:
- **Purpose**: Controls how quickly suspension extends after compression
- **Effects**: 
  - Controls roll speed (not total roll amount)
  - Affects corner transition behavior
  - Too stiff causes "jacking down" effect

**Corner-Specific Effects**:
- **Turn Entry**: Front rebound affects understeer/oversteer balance
- **Turn Exit**: Rear bump affects traction and stability
- **Transitions**: Critical for maintaining balance during direction changes

## Anti-Roll Bars

### Function
Control body roll without affecting spring rates or ride quality over single-wheel bumps.

### Tuning Effects

**Front Anti-Roll Bar**:
- **Stiffer**: Increases understeer, reduces front grip
- **Softer**: Reduces understeer, increases front grip

**Rear Anti-Roll Bar**:
- **Stiffer**: Increases oversteer, reduces rear grip
- **Softer**: Reduces oversteer, increases rear grip

### Key Principles
- **Balance**: Relative stiffness between front and rear determines handling balance
- **Operation**: Most effective in mid-corner when dampers/springs are fully compressed
- **Adjustment**: Fine-tune understeer/oversteer characteristics

- **Rear-Heavy**: Increases oversteer, improves traction (RWD)

**Left/Right Balance**:
- **Oval Racing**: Favor left side for constant turning direction
- **Road Racing**: Maintain equal side weights for balanced handling

### Ballast Placement Strategy

**Objectives**:
1. **Meet Weight Requirements**: Add ballast to reach minimum weight
2. **Optimize Balance**: Position ballast to improve handling
3. **Adjustability**: Allow for fine-tuning between sessions

**Placement Guidelines**:
- **Low Position**: Lower center of gravity improves handling
- **Central Location**: Minimizes polar moment of inertia
- **Strategic Positioning**: Use ballast to achieve target weight distribution

**Vehicle-Specific Recommendations**:
- **Front-Engine RWD**: Add rear ballast if weight distribution is 55/45 or more front-heavy
- **Mid-Engine**: Rarely requires ballast due to optimal weight distribution
- **AWD**: Typically doesn't need ballast placement optimization

### Fuel Considerations

**Race Strategy**:
- **Start of Race**: Higher fuel load affects balance
- **End of Race**: Lower fuel load changes handling characteristics
- **Compromise Setting**: Balance setup for average fuel load

**Setup Implications**:
- **Corner Balance**: Significant fuel consumption changes weight distribution
- **Spring Rates**: May need adjustment for varying fuel loads
- **Ride Height**: Changes with fuel load affect aerodynamics
